# fn-fx-ui

A spike with `fn-fx` to build a simple GUI with Clojure and JavaFX.

## Issues
- Order of `requires` is important to get JavaFX initialize correctly and prevent issues with
threads

### Starting app from Leiningen [SOLVED]
Had trouble to get `lein run` or Uberjar to work, program exits immediately after rendering
the UI, fixed via `(:gen-class :extends javafx.application.Application)`

### Modal Dialog [SOLVED]
Struggling to show a Dialog with the `fn-fx` library at this needs to be run from the event
thread but I don't know how to get it there, might also be an JavaFX lifecycle issue as
indicated by
[this SO answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33966259/javafx-thread-issues/34005514#34005514).

Solved it by using the function `run-and-wait` to show the dialog.

### Diffing fails in some cases [SOLVED]
The following issues means that the window sometimes needs to be closed and restarted via `(-main)`
to have state changes propagate to the GUI.
When updating the table data the diffing to rerender the UI can fail because of an not yet
implemented function:

```
#error {
 :cause Assert failed: TODO: Implement this
(= idx (dec (count lst)))
 :via
 [{:type java.lang.AssertionError
   :message Assert failed: TODO: Implement this
(= idx (dec (count lst)))
   :at [fn_fx.fx_dom.FXDom$fn__971 invoke fx_dom.clj 39]}]
 :trace
 [[fn_fx.fx_dom.FXDom$fn__971 invoke fx_dom.clj 39]
  [clojure.lang.AFn run AFn.java 22]
  [com.sun.javafx.application.PlatformImpl lambda$null$173 PlatformImpl.java 295]
  [java.security.AccessController doPrivileged AccessController.java -2]
  [com.sun.javafx.application.PlatformImpl lambda$runLater$174 PlatformImpl.java 294]
  [com.sun.glass.ui.InvokeLaterDispatcher$Future run InvokeLaterDispatcher.java 95]]}
#error {
 :cause Assert failed: TODO: Implement this
(= idx (dec (count lst)))
 :via
 [{:type java.lang.AssertionError
   :message Assert failed: TODO: Implement this
(= idx (dec (count lst)))
   :at [fn_fx.fx_dom.FXDom$fn__971 invoke fx_dom.clj 39]}]
 :trace
 [[fn_fx.fx_dom.FXDom$fn__971 invoke fx_dom.clj 39]
  [clojure.lang.AFn run AFn.java 22]
  [com.sun.javafx.application.PlatformImpl lambda$null$173 PlatformImpl.java 295]
  [java.security.AccessController doPrivileged AccessController.java -2]
  [com.sun.javafx.application.PlatformImpl lambda$runLater$174 PlatformImpl.java 294]
  [com.sun.glass.ui.InvokeLaterDispatcher$Future run InvokeLaterDispatcher.java 95]]}
```

### Constructing components that have a constructor with mandatory arguments [SOLVED]

For example ScatterPlot needs to have two axes in the constructor. Just using
`controls/scatter-plot` seems not to allow passing those. `render-core/construct-control` seems to
be something that might get used to do that.

To trigger that, one would need to call `create-component!` not with a keyword `type` but a vector
`[tp args]`.

I was able to build the component myself via `diff/component` providing the class as keyword, an
empty vector of `arg-names` (because the constructor has empty `prop-names-kw`) and the mandatory
axes. This seems to be a bit brittle, because there is another constructor which has empty
`prop-names-kw` but needs a third argument, the data to be plotted. At some point this constructor
might be chosen by `diff/component` instead of the one we need.

### Java process not quit after closing (last) window [WORKAROUND]

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15808063/how-to-stop-javafx-application-thread/22997736#22997736

I was able to force close the application with this approach, setting an onClose EventHandler for
the main stage:

```
(defn -start [app stage]
  (let [exit (reify javafx.event.EventHandler
               (handle [this event]
                 (println "Closing application")
                 (javafx.application.Platform/exit)))]
    (doto stage
      (.setOnCloseRequest exit)
      (.setTitle "FOO")
      (.show))))
```

### Diffing fails when setting values to nil [SOLVED]

For the table view the `:items` key is used to set the table cell contents. When resetting the data
(to an empty array) the empty list `(rest data)` ended up as a diff case `[:val :nil]` which was not
implemented so I added that to `fn-fx.diff`
([see GitHub](https://github.com/nblumoe/fn-fx/tree/add-val-to-nil-diff)).
